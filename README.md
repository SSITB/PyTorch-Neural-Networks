# PyTorch-Neural-Networks
My journey into learning and creating neural networks with the [PyTorch Framework](https://pytorch.org/).

Currently, I have completed 1 end to end project using PyTorch. Specifically, I created a deep neural network to classify images of flowers! A high level overview of the process can be found in the notebook!

After finishing development, I turned much of the code from the notebook into a command line application! You can find the scripts for this in the `app/` directory.

These notebooks and scripts are not intended to be a deep dive into Deep Learning concepts. Rather, this repository exists to showcase my technical ability in PyTorch and assisting others in finding examples of PyTorch code.
